If you don't have "node" installed in your machine, go to https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and install it.

First run the command:

    npm install

Then you can use the following commands:

    npm run build - To generate the .js files
    npm run bvd - To generate the .js files and run the application
    npm run vd - To run the application

Any cipher text you wanna try, just drop in the /data folder and the application should list it do be decoded
